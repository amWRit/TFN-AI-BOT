The environment at home didn’t help, and during the Maoist insurgency, I was sent to a public school, where resources were even more limited. But everything changed when one teacher arrived and saw something in me that no one else did.\r\n\r\nThis teacher organized a story competition at school, and to my surprise, I won. For the first time, I felt a spark of hope, a belief that I could achieve something. That moment was my turning point. I began doing well in my studies and even placed among the top students in my class. I learned firsthand how a compassionate teacher can change a student’s life, and that realization has stayed with me ever since.\r\n\r\nI want to join Teach For Nepal because I believe quality education, when combined with compassion, can transform students' lives, just like it did for me.

But over time, I learned to face those insecurities, embrace my voice, and find strength in my vulnerability. These experiences have made me deeply empathetic toward students who may be navigating similar challenges. I want to be the kind of teacher who helps them feel seen and valued, who listens without judgment, and who believes in their potential even when they can’t see it themselves.\r\nWhat draws me most to Teach For Nepal is the humane side of education—the opportunity to connect with students in a way that uplifts their spirit and sees them as humans with stories, lives, hopes, and dreams.

One defining moment that deeply impacted me was her time in Sindhupalchowk as a school inspector shortly after the earthquake. Despite the devastation, she led psychosocial counseling for students and teachers, helped distribute relief, and was deeply involved in rebuilding efforts. Her commitment to service and her ability to lead with compassion and strength have always inspired me. It was during this time that she came into contact with Teach For Nepal, which introduced me to the Fellowship at an early age. \r\n\r\nFor a long time, I didn’t think I would apply.

She saw it as the key to unlocking opportunities and creating a better life. And so, despite the challenges we faced, she did everything in her power to ensure I received a good education.\r\n\r\nI was lucky to have wonderful teachers like Shovana Ma’am, who not only taught me valuable life skills but also inspired me to become a teacher myself. They made me believe that I too could make a difference in the lives of young students. But just when I thought my journey was set, I received some devastating news. My scholarship program was being cut due to restrictions from the social welfare council. After over a decade of working in education, it felt like my life had come to a halt.

The rules and regulations in my school were very strict. In my school most of the students were from elite families, and many of us felt that our teachers supported them more than the children from middle class families like ours. At the same time, I was an average student. This meant that I used to be neglected by my teachers a lot and was frequently punished. I passed my SLC in 1st division and completed rest of my education from Padma Kanya Multiple College. I initially started a Bachelor’s in Business Studies, but I left that,…",

But his family’s economic condition wasn’t good so he left school and went to Qatar to earn a living.

Seeing all this, I certainly wanted to earn as soon as I complete my schooling. \r\n I was always an average student from my childhood. Initially, my teachers did not believe that I would pass in any of my exams. As a result, I failed terribly in Physics. I asked for help from my friends at school, and during their free time, they used to help me with their notes. After that day, I have never failed in any exam.

It’s a very new thing to me because I’ve never really left home. Never stayed in a hostel.\r\nAs a Social work student, I am excited to put the theories I’d learnt into practice to solve the conflicts and problems in villages.

This situation made me think that if I were the teacher of this class, this wouldn’t happen.\r\nIn 2015, I started a joint Masters degree in Education and Sustainable Development. I always remember that class eight’s situation and was in search of the best platform for giving quality education and that is when I found Teach For Nepal. I now feel proud to be a Fellow and excited by the possibility to improve students’ learning situations. Beyond this I hope that Teach For Nepal will help me to develop my abilities and prepare me\r\nfor my future in the teaching sector.
