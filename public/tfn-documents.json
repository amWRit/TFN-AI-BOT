There are several reasons why our \npublic education is failing. Teach for Nepal focuses on two primary problems:\n1. Lack of sufficient resources\nMost public schools are under-resourced and struggle to both get and retain teachers. In \nschools where the government has not allocated enough teachers, or in remote areas where \nteachers do not want to live, primary school teachers have to teach secondary level students. \nAs a result, teachers are overburdened and the education of students appearing for the SLC  is\nbeing compromised by teachers who  are not qualified to adequately prepare them to excel in \nthe board examination.\n2.
